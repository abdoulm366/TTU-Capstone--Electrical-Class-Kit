# Electrical and Computer Engineering EV Kit


## Executive Summary

The purpose of this project is to provide an instructional tool that effectively introduces users to the basics and principles of ECE in an interesting and thorough way. These basics and principles will be shown through EV operation to demonstrate these electrical concepts in a physical or mechanical manner. The EV build will allow for fluid interaction with the user, allowing them to manipulate different operations of the car depending on their input. The main topics to be taught through this kit will include but not be limited to, circuits and electronics, signals and systems, control systems, and computing. All members of the team have a viable backrground in each of these courses, and will use their current knowledge while acquiring new knowledge to ensure the success of the project. 

## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.

__Dave Placide__

__Jesse Griffey__ is an electrical engineering major at Tennessee Technological University, interested in the power and mechatronics aspects of his field. He is responsible for the Closed Loop Control system, using his background in controls and coding for the system.

__Keston Robbins__

__Slayde Simmons__ is majoring in Electrical Engineering at Tennessee Technological Unversity. He is interested in power systems and renewable engery as a focus for a career. In this project he is responsible for the noise cancelation system with a background in signal processing and coding. 

__Troy Dunn__ is majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Mathematics at Tennessee Technological University. He is interested in power systems, electronics, and PLC design. He will be working with Mahle Engine Components, Morristown, TN in the summer of 2024 as an electrical engineering intern. Troy is responsible for the wireless charging subsystem with a background in electronics, power, and electromagnetic fields. 


### Faculty Supervisor

Mr. Jesse Roberts - ECE Department

### Stakeholders

The Primary stakeholder for this project is Dr. Kumar Yelamarthi. Dr. Yelamarthi is an Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

One major stakeholder that will be affected is upcoming engineering prospects. Persons interested in the ECE degree will have the opportunity to utilize this kit as an introduction to the ECE curriculum. 

Another stakeholder that will be affected by the project will be universities. Universities will have the opportunity to purchase the kit to use in their introductory ECE courses, potentially gaining the interest of future students. 

### Recognitions

The team would like to thank Mr. Jesse Roberts, Dr. Stephen Canfield, and Dr. Charles Van Neste for their valuable feedback and taking their time of day to work with us and help us improve on our ideas and goals of this project. 

## Repo Organization

Give the layout of the repo and what can be found where. Make it easy on those who are interested by making the headings of the various things in this section clickable links to the relevant folder or file in the repo.


### Reports

In the reports section of this repository information about the individual expectations for the reports and how they should be housed is provided.

### Documentation

In the documentaion section information regarding the documentation that is required and how it should be organized is given.

### Software
