#Input Breadboard Subsystem
##Subsystem Function:

 The breadboard subsystem serves as a method for the user to interact
 with the project. The user will be given several circuit components,
 including resistors, capacitors, and other circuit components. This
 subsystem will be built separately from the body of the “car”, as
 adjusting the circuit layout on a moving vehicle might prove to be a
 little troublesome. The blocks will contain real circuit components
 and will be made in a way that no polarities can get mixed up, which
 eliminates any risk of overcurrent. Instead, these components will be
 connected to sensor circuits (resistive, capacitive, etc.). The
 circuits will send that data to a microcontroller to be analyzed and
 utilized in the rest of the project. Using these sensor circuits is
 also safer, as there is no risk of accidentally putting too much
 current through a component and comprising the subsystem. Also on this
 breadboard will be some switches, buttons, and other general input
 components. These will be hardwired in and control the outputs
 assigned to other subsystems.

Figure 2: Sensor Circuit

The schematic is divided up into two separate pieces. The first piece
(Figure 1) is comprised of all the blocks the user will be able to
insert into the sensor circuit (Figure 2). These values, as will be
shown in the analysis, were chosen carefully so that there was a wide
range of values to choose from as well as enough separation between each
value so that computation would yield results that vary enough to be
accurately measured. The titles of each block describe what is contained
inside. The gold pieces in both the blocks and the sensor circuit
represent contacts to allow the flow of current between the blocks and
the sensor circuit when they are connected.

Once a block is placed in the appropriate slot (left to right =
Resistor, Capacitor, and Diode), then the reference circuit built into
the sensor is completed, and that voltage is picked up and transmitted
to one of the Uno’s analog input pins. Once the MCU receives this data,
it will make adequate adjustments to other various parts of the project
depending on what value was read in.

<u>Analysis:</u>

The analysis for this subsystem is straightforward. Simple voltage
division equations can be used to determine the reading of the output
voltage. This equation, in its general form reads,
$V\_{\\text{out}} = V\_{s}(\\frac{R\_{\\text{block}}}{{R\_{\\text{reference}} + R}\_{\\text{block}}})$.
Doing all of the substitutions with the appropriate values yields the
following results:

| *V*<sub>*S*</sub> (V) | *R*<sub>block</sub> (Ω) | *R*<sub>reference</sub> (Ω) | *V*<sub>out</sub> (V) |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 3.3                   | 10 ± 0.5                | 1000 ± 50                   | 0.03 ± 0.0021         |

| 3.3                   | 500 ± 25                | 1000 ± 50                   | 1.10 ± 0.077          |

The resulting output voltages are calculated using gold-band resistors
which have a tolerance of 5% of their indicated resistance value. Aside
from one value, there is far from any overlap, and that instance was
intentional, as it was put there in order to demonstrate parallel and
series connections of resistors more thoroughly.

The next bit of analysis necessary is for the capacitor sensing. The
capacitor (in a dc circuit) will charge up to a point where then it will
block any more current from flowing through it. While many approaches
can be taken to measure capacitance, this project will utilize a simple
method that is as follows: the capacitor will slowly increase in voltage
until it hits the 5-volt threshold. However, if we know the time from
0.2 volts (accounting for the circuit when there is no capacitor
inserted) to 3.5 volts, then we can use the elapsed time between these
two points to determine which capacitor was plugged in. This can be
simulated in LTSpice, which is where these figures will come from.
Attached below are simulations of all the circuits, followed by a table
laying out the times.

As can be seen above in the table and the pictures, the time never
exceeds 1.2 seconds, so the constraint of working within 2 seconds is
easily met. The times are also different enough that there’s no chance
of mistaking one value for another.

Lastly, the diode block is the easiest to both understand and calculate.
Since the diode is a binary-acting device, its output voltage is either
high or zero. Most diodes have a 0.7 voltage drop, and since the Peak
Inverse Voltage is far less than even 5 volts, all it will have to do is
block current going the other way. The analog in port will then find
that the voltage is zero, and appropriate adjustments can be made to
affect the rest of the project.
