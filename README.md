Mr. Jesse Roberts - ECE Department

### Stakeholders

The Primary stakeholder for this project is Dr. Kumar Yelamarthi. Dr. Yelamarthi is an Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

One major stakeholder that will be affected is upcoming engineering prospects. Persons interested in the ECE degree will have the opportunity to utilize this kit as an introduction to the ECE curriculum. 

Another stakeholder that will be affected by the project will be universities. Universities will have the opportunity to purchase the kit to use in their introductory ECE courses, potentially gaining the interest of future students. 

### Recognitions

The team would like to thank Mr. Jesse Roberts, Dr. Stephen Canfield, and Dr. Charles Van Neste for their valuable feedback and taking their time of day to work with us and help us improve on our ideas and goals of this project.
