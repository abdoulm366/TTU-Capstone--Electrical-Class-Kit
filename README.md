# TTU-Capstone-Team-6

# Electrical Class Kit - Your project should have a catchy and functional name

The descriptions and information in all readme files in the starter repo (including this one) must be edited. All section descriptions must be deleted. Any failure to remove the description information (like the statement that you are currently reading) will be heavily penalized!

## Executive Summary

## Capabilities

Here explain in more detail (though not as much as will be given in the datasheet) what the version of this project in this repo is capable of doing.


## Salient Outcomes

Projects often have some outcomes that are more interesting than others. Here, highlight those things that you found interesting!


## Project Demonstration & Images

Give a link to a video of the project being demonstrated. The video should be hosted on the capstone youtube.

Below the video link show some well-taken, appropriately sized images of the project.
