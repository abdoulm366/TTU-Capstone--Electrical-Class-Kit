# Electrical and Computer Engineering EV Kit


## Executive Summary

The purpose of this project is to provide an instructional tool that effectively introduces users to the basics and principles of ECE in an interesting and thorough way. These basics and principles will be shown through EV operation to demonstrate these electrical concepts in a physical or mechanical manner. The EV build will allow for fluid interaction with the user, allowing them to manipulate different operations of the car depending on their input. The main topics to be taught through this kit will include but not be limited to, circuits and electronics, signals and systems, control systems, and computing. All members of the team have a viable backrground in each of these courses, and will use their current knowledge while acquiring new knowledge to ensure the success of the project. 

## Capabilities

At the end of Capstone 2, the team is expected to have a fully functioning kit. The kit will have multiple capabilities relating to the functionality of an EV car. Firstly, it will be capable of allowing user input from the input subsystem which will provide a certain output depending on user selection. The possible outputs include but are not limited to, driving forwards and backwards, steering left and right, adjustable sound system, and adjustable lighting system. The car will also have the capability of charging wirelessly and storing the charged energy, but will have a seperate power system. Also, the kit will be capable of providing instructions through computing.

### Faculty Supervisor

Mr. Jesse Roberts - ECE Department

### Stakeholders

The Primary stakeholder for this project is Dr. Kumar Yelamarthi. Dr. Yelamarthi is an Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

One major stakeholder that will be affected is upcoming engineering prospects. Persons interested in the ECE degree will have the opportunity to utilize this kit as an introduction to the ECE curriculum. 

Another stakeholder that will be affected by the project will be universities. Universities will have the opportunity to purchase the kit to use in their introductory ECE courses, potentially gaining the interest of future students. 

### Recognitions

The team would like to thank Mr. Jesse Roberts, Dr. Stephen Canfield, and Dr. Charles Van Neste for their valuable feedback and taking their time of day to work with us and help us improve on our ideas and goals of this project. 

## Repo Organization

For the layout of the projects organization, there are three main folders including, reports, documentation, and software.

### Reports

The reports folder includes the team contract, project proposal, and conceptual design.
